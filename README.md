## í¿º Overview
In ancient Rome, a *Praetor* orchestrated civic order. **Praetor Desk** channels that spirit: a local-first desktop application where solopreneurs, founders, and ADHD superhumans can coordinate crypto airdrops, projects, ideas, research, and household duties without browser chaos or cloud lock-in.

Everything runs on your machine using **Tauri 2**, **React 18**, and **SQLite**. Data stays local, performance stays snappy, and each tab is purpose-built yet visually cohesive.

---

## âš”ï¸ Feature Highlights
- **Unified Workspace** â€“ Six polished tabs with consistent UI patterns for quick context switching.
- **Airdrop Intelligence** â€“ Track quests, wallet states, and task progress for every campaign.
- **Project Momentum** â€“ Manage deliverables with inline task adds, status pills, and delightful glassmorphism.
- **Idea Vault** â€“ Capture sparks with notes, timestamps, and low-friction entry.
- **Brainstorm Superpowers** â€“ Run Context7 â†’ Exa research to gather up-to-date references in a single click.
- **Household HQ** â€“ Keep chores and reminders actionable, not floating in your head.
- **Google OAuth UI** â€“ Ready for plug-and-play calendar sync once backend OAuth2 5.x flow is finalised.
- **Local-First SQLite** â€“ Everything stored in `praetor_desk.db` under your OS app data directory.

## í·‚ Modules
| Tab | What it Delivers |
| --- | --- |
| **Airdrops** | Campaign cards with wallet chips, chain badges, progress bars, daily quest toggles, and upcoming task counts. |
| **Projects** | Project cards with status pills, inline task input, completion toggles, and glassmorphism UI. |
| **Ideas** | Idea grid with quick capture, optional notes, creation timestamps, and gentle deletion confirmations. |
| **Brainstorm** | Research surface with call-to-action header, textarea prompts, and rich card outputs for Context7 + Exa MCP servers. |
| **House** | Habit tracker for chores and tools â€” styled checkboxes, card actions, and note snippets. |
| **Calendar** | Google OAuth â€œSign in with Googleâ€ experience with stubbed backend (UI is production-ready, token exchange coming soon). |

---

## í·° Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Desktop Shell:** Tauri 2 (Rust), custom window controls
- **Styling:** Tailwind-inspired design tokens, bespoke card components, `lucide-react` icons
- **State & API:** Local React state + Tauri command invocations
- **Persistence:** SQLite via SQLx migrations (`src-tauri/src/database.rs`)
- **Research Integrations:** Context7 MCP + Exa MCP (optional)

---

## âš™ï¸ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/enstest1/Praetor_Desk.git
cd Praetor_Desk
pnpm install              # or npm install
docs/assets/praetor-desk-banner.png  # ensure banner image is present
pnpm tauri dev            # run the app in development
```

### Database
SQLite is auto-created at app start: `AppData/Local/praetor_desk/praetor_desk.db` (platform-specific). All migrations live in `src-tauri/src/database.rs`.

### Optional MCP Servers (Brainstorm Tab)
```bash
# in separate shells
context7-mcp --port 7080
exa-mcp --port 7081
```
Then configure within the Brainstorm tab or your Cursor MCP settings.

2. **Projects Tab** â€“ Add quick tasks, change statuses, focus on the dayâ€™s deliverables.
3. **Ideas Tab** â€“ Capture sparks and link to later actions.
4. **Brainstorm Tab** â€“ Run Context7 â†’ Exa research to gather citations for content or outreach.
5. **House Tab** â€“ Keep personal life on track with checklists.
6. **Calendar Tab** â€“ Use Google OAuth UI (backend finishing soon) to pull upcoming events.
